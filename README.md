=========================
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/lucasfe/mood.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/lucasfe/mood)

Introduction
------------
This is a sample project to showcase android architectures and components. Basically this projects aims
to create an app that will check for a list of tweets and predict its mood.


Getting Started
---------------
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There are two Gradle tasks for testing the project:
* `connectedAndroidTest` - for running Espresso on a connected device
* `test` - for running unit tests

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.

  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
